/* 
Leetcode 167 : Two sum II - Input Array is sprted.

Apporach : A two-pointer approach could be helpful here.

The idea is that use two pointer left and right.
Initialize left pointer with 0 and right to (n-1) .
Now store sum of left and right array and,
compare that sum of there is equal to target or not.
if sum is less than target than move left pointer to +1,
else if sum is greater than target than move right pointer to -1.

Note : In this question,  Given a 1-indexed array of integers.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        int n = numbers.size();
        int left = 0; 
        int right = n-1;

        while(left < right)
        {
            int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
            if(sum == target) return {left+1, right+1};
            else if(sum < target) left++;
            else right--;
        }
        return {-1, -1};
    }
};
