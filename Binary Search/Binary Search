/* 
LeetCode 704 : Binary Search.
Apporach : use two pointer, left and right.
point left = first, and right = last element.
Run a while loop until left is not greater than right.
while iterating find mid of array and check if it is equl to target than return it
other wise if mid is less than target than place left to mid + 1 or if mid is greater, than place right to mid -1 position.

Time Complexity : O(log n).
Space Complexity : O(1).
