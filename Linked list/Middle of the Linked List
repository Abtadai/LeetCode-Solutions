/*
Leetcode 876 : Middle of linked list.

Apporach : By fast and slow pointer.
both point to head at starting, than move fast by two nodes and slow by only one step.
Until fast or fast's next is not equal to NUll than return slow.

Time complexity : O(n).   // Because we iterating through every node atleast once.
Space Complexity : O(1). // not using any extra space to store anything.
