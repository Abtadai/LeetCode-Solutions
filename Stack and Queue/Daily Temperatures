/* 
LeetCode 739 : Daily Temperatures.
Apporach : Make a stack and push index 0 in it (because for index 0, we donot have any greater element right now)

Check for every index from 1 to n

If element less than this number are present in stack just keep on popping them and 
update in your answer array the difference in indexes of both of these (we want distance between index of these 2 numbers, right)

Push the index for which you were checking in the stack (bcoz we have not got any element greater than this element)

--> Time Complexity : O(n)
--> Space Complexity : O(n)

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> dailyTemperatures(vector<int>& temperatures) {
        int n = temperatures.size();
        vector<int> ans(n, 0);
        stack<int> st; // store indices

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            while (!st.empty() && temperatures[i] > temperatures[st.top()]) {
                int idx = st.top();
                st.pop();
                ans[idx] = i - idx;
            }
            st.push(i);
        }
        return ans;
    }
